title:  "Blogging on GitHub"
---

This is my new blog using Jekyll. It's hosted using GitHub Pages and using the theme and layout from [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) for now.

The setup took less than 15 minutes, so I would consider this a pretty lightweight, fast, and free way to start blogging.
