**0 interest is an interest level**

I just stumbled upon a viral-ish X post where most of the commenters made fun of Grant Cardone, a known ‚Äúgrifter‚Äù in a lot of people‚Äôs eyes:
[Grant Cardone has an IQ of 42 and is worth $600 million. What is holding you back?](https://twitter.com/ParikPatelCFA/status/1778189186266505649)

A comical thesis he proposed was that ‚Äú0 interest, is an interest level‚Äù. Which I don‚Äôt recommend you try unless you want HR to randomly Zoom you.

When you have a perception of a person, it‚Äôs hard to not have a certain prediposed bias. Instead of taking it face value I thought about it a bit more. Is there any possible nugget of wisdom or something we can learn here? While you may not need to agree 100% you should be aware of these biases that might potentially shoot down ideas pre-emptively.

After some more thought, I believe what he was trying to say is when you want to sell something to someone who has 0 interest level, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. The ‚Äú0 interest level‚Äù is a litmus or calibration point to effectively tell you where you are at in this person‚Äôs mind.

In software engineering, we are constantly exchanging ideas back and forth and trying to build consensus. Believe it or not one does not simply read How to Win Friends and Influence People and become an expert in soft skills as repeatedly pitched by managers around the world.

Something I saw in my last company was the idea of TDD or Testing culture. Principal engineers would vouch for the bugs saved or the cost savings from re-work. Being able to be agile and move fast while having regression safety net. On the flip side there are cultures that do not embrace testing as it slows them down, etc. Regardless, to say, testing was mandated, but how effective was it exactly? Thats not the topic of this post but the semination of ideas into your organization.

**Building organizational consensus:**

***Build the why:***
Listing benefits that people already know isn‚Äôt going to necessarily help in my experience. Non technical people prefer ROI/Cost savings, data helps a lot. Listening and solving their major pain points from their point of view helps.
If you are just simply trying to practice resume driven development or over optimize/refactor a piece of your code base with no convincable benefits, you are probably going to get shot down.

On a random side note on Clean Code. I highly recommend this very informative debate between Bob Martin and Casey M:
[https://github.com/unclebob/cmuratori-discussion/blob/main/cleancodeqa.md](https://github.com/unclebob/cmuratori-discussion/blob/main/cleancodeqa.md)
It's a very good case study of two programmers coming from two different backgrounds on why they believe in their philosophies.

***Involve your team early:***
I think a more effective approach is talking to your co-workers one by one, and listening to their ideas.
You can then achieve better overall buy in now that everyone is on board.
If you can then sell why your new idea or approach is saving them from a pain point(or for non technical people, make $), you are going to better be able to get consensus.
Include team members in decision-making from the start, seeking their input and concerns. This fosters ownership and commitment to the change.

***Provide Education and Training for Ease of adoptability:***

Offer training on testing importance, methodologies, and best practices. Empowering team members with knowledge helps them embrace the change confidently. To introduce a new process or idea, it must be low barrier or small investment for users to adopt. If it‚Äôs something completely ridiculous and creates more work it‚Äôs obviously a no.

Having an ‚Äúescape hatch‚Äù or a backup plan can provide reassurance and mitigate the fear of failure when implementing changes in a company. It allows for a safety net in case the change doesn‚Äôt yield the expected results or faces unforeseen challenges. This backup plan can include alternative strategies, contingency measures, or even a way to revert to previous processes if necessary.

Sometimes dumb ideas, can have benefits that you never thought, tying back into the idea that a company culture that embraces psychological safety will have a lot more potential for innovation versus ideas simply mandated from an ivory tower.

If all else fails just become the CEO of your own company üòÇ
