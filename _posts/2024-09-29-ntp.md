In any time-sensitive application, such as those relying on **SAML authentication**, ensuring your server’s time is accurate is critical. A common culprit for time-related issues is **clock drift**, which happens when your server's time gradually becomes inaccurate. This blog post will cover how to detect and fix clock drift using **NTP** (Network Time Protocol), ensuring your system is always in sync with global time standards.

## What is Clock Drift?

**Clock drift** refers to the gradual deviation of a system's clock from the actual, accurate time. It happens because every system has an internal clock that measures time, and these clocks aren’t always perfectly accurate. The drift may be small, but over time it can accumulate, causing significant discrepancies between your system's time and the real time.

For example, a system clock might drift **a few seconds per day**. Over a few weeks, this could turn into minutes or even hours of difference, depending on the system. This can lead to major problems in **time-sensitive operations** like:

- Authentication (e.g., SAML, OAuth)
- Cache expiration
- Database transactions with time-based queries
- Time-sensitive event scheduling

## What is NTP?

**NTP (Network Time Protocol)** is a protocol used to synchronize your system’s clock with a highly accurate time source, like an atomic clock or a GPS clock. NTP works by periodically querying remote time servers, which provide the correct time, and adjusting the system's clock as necessary to stay in sync.

### How NTP Sync Fixes Clock Drift

NTP fixes clock drift by ensuring that your system regularly checks a reliable time source and corrects its internal clock. Once NTP is installed and configured, your system will constantly adjust its time to stay as close as possible to the global time standard.

## Fixing NTP Sync on a System

Here’s how you can check and fix NTP synchronization issues on a typical Linux server running an application.

### Step 1: Check Current Time Sync Status

Before making changes, you can check if your system’s time is synchronized by using the following command:

```bash
timedatectl status
```

This command will tell you if your system clock is synchronized or if there are issues.

Here’s an example of what you might see:

```bash
               Local time: Fri 2024-09-30 14:15:02 UTC
           Universal time: Fri 2024-09-30 14:15:02 UTC
                 RTC time: Fri 2024-09-30 14:15:02
                Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)
System clock synchronized: no
              NTP service: inactive
          RTC in local TZ: no
```

In this case, **"System clock synchronized: no"** indicates that the system is not currently synchronized, which could lead to clock drift.

### Step 2: Install NTP or Chrony

On most Linux distributions, you can use **NTP** or **Chrony** to sync your system’s clock. **Chrony** is often preferred for modern systems because it’s faster and more efficient, but NTP is still widely used.

#### Installing NTP:

On Ubuntu or Debian systems, install NTP with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ntp
```

For Red Hat or CentOS systems:

```bash
sudo yum install ntp
```

#### Installing Chrony:

If you prefer **Chrony** instead:

```bash
sudo apt install chrony   # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install chrony   # CentOS/RedHat
```

### Step 3: Enable and Start the NTP Service

Once NTP (or Chrony) is installed, you need to enable and start the service to begin syncing the time.

For NTP:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ntp
sudo systemctl start ntp
```

For Chrony:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable chronyd
sudo systemctl start chronyd
```

### Step 4: Verify Time Synchronization

After starting the service, you can check if the synchronization is working with the following command:

```bash
timedatectl status
```

You should now see something like:

```bash
               Local time: Fri 2024-09-30 14:20:00 UTC
           Universal time: Fri 2024-09-30 14:20:00 UTC
                 RTC time: Fri 2024-09-30 14:20:00
                Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no
```

The key field here is **"System clock synchronized: yes"**, which indicates that your server’s time is now properly synchronized.

### Step 5: Test NTP Sync

To check how your system is performing in terms of time synchronization, you can use the `ntpq` command to get details about the time servers your system is syncing with:

```bash
ntpq -p
```

This will give you a table showing the servers being used for synchronization, along with the delay and offset:

```
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
*time.nist.gov   .NIST.           1 u   23   64  377   52.123   -0.987   1.145
+clock.isc.org   .GPS.            1 u   30   64  377   30.245    0.245   0.987
```

In this table, you want to see **low offsets and jitter values**, indicating that your system's clock is close to being perfectly in sync with the external time source.

## What Happens if NTP is Not Set Up?

Without NTP, your system will slowly experience **clock drift**, and over time, the system clock will become inaccurate. This can cause issues in:

- **Authentication protocols** like SAML, where tokens are only valid for short time windows.
- **Scheduled tasks** that rely on accurate timing.
- **Logging systems**, where out-of-sync times can make debugging difficult.
- **Database records**, where time-sensitive queries (`updated_at`, `created_at`) can lead to inconsistencies.

In extreme cases, significant time discrepancies can cause downtime, particularly for systems dependent on strict time validation.

## How Does Clock Drift Occur?

Clock drift happens because no hardware clock is perfect. The reasons include:

1. **Hardware limitations**: System clocks are built with internal quartz crystals that vibrate to keep time. However, due to imperfections in the crystals, temperature changes, or electrical noise, the vibrations may vary slightly, leading to time drift.

2. **System load**: If your server is under heavy load, its internal clock may lose time accuracy as the CPU focuses on other tasks.

3. **Power fluctuations**: Inconsistent power delivery to a system can cause its clock to drift.

Without regular synchronization via NTP, these issues accumulate over time, making the system clock increasingly inaccurate.

## Conclusion

Ensuring that your system stays in sync with global time standards using **NTP** is critical for time-sensitive operations. Whether you're dealing with authentication systems, database queries, or scheduled tasks, clock drift can cause serious issues if left unchecked. With NTP or Chrony properly configured, your system can automatically correct its clock drift, keeping your applications running smoothly and securely.
